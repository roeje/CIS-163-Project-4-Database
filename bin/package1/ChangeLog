ChangeLog File

This file is for telling you what I've changed in the Program so far.

I Created a series of tests for the student class. Some Simple getter and setter method testing.
As well as, the Sorting function tests. There's a sort test for the last name sort, and one 
to test if the sort function works given the last names are the the same. 

Also I've changed one little itty bit of the delStudent method in the Linked list i noticed
that when you get down to one item in the list the pointers would not point to the correct
objects. Such as, previous would still point to the node that it would still delete.

There's one additional case statement within that method to ensure the list is nullified.
Pretty straight forward if tail and head point to the same node. Just set tail to null
and head to null. The node is then nom nom by the garbage collector in Java. 

-Ben.

So... this Time i've finished adding a few more buttons to GUI, making sure some of the methods work
within the GUI panel. 

Also, The Update button parses the top text fields, and finds a person based on the GNumber
that is within the text area at the top. 

So a person's information is based on the parameters gNumber in the text field at the top, and changed
using the information using the first name fields, and last name fields.
